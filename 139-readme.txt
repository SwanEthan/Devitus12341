Moon Base Gamma
Official Walkthrough

In this game, you as the player spawn in a haunted moonbase with alarms going off all around you. Your goal is either to 
find a way to escape off the moon or to kill the demon that is haunting the moonbase. However, the more astute player may 
be able to discover a secret ending to the game. The game contains many clues scattered throughout on how to progress. The
game also contains some easter eggs in the library, these are not necessary to the completion of the game and are purely 
inside jokes among the developers. 

It is important to note that there are no “doors” in this game. A player will move directly into the next room UNLESS they
require an object like a key to get into the room. For example, if the player moves east from the Hangar they will move 
directly into the bridge. However, if the player moves east from the Bridge to the Command Control, the player will only 
be moved directly to Command if they have the key. 

Below is how to achieve the shortest possible playthrough for each of the four endings, as well as the commands the player
must use to perform actions within the game. Be aware that you may have to discover some of the more specific actions in the
game by exploring a little bit. Have fun!

“Look [subject]” = Player will look at subject
“Take [subject]” = Player will take subject
“Go [cardinal direction] = Player will move that direction
“Enter rocket” = Player will enter the rocket
“Open door” = Player will open the hidden door
